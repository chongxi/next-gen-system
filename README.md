# Next generation system
Work in progress repository for next generation acquisition and closed-loop
feedback system.

This should eventually not just an open ephys associated standard and will
possibly be moved to a different host org. Ideally we could end up with a set
of open, and evolving interface standards, code blocks and APIs that many
different projects can adapt parts of.

See here for a working draft of the specifications:

For now, we should try to build a working proof-of-principle prototype that we
can use as starting point to develop proper standards.
